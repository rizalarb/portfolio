##### (Feb 2024)

The rise of hoax news and false information which is widely spread with the aim of misleading the public. The Indonesian Anti Defamation Society (Mafindo), an independent community established, focuses on providing education about hoax news. However, the process of verifying news is currently mostly done manually, so it is not effective enough to deal with the widespread number of hoax news. Therefore, a research effort was made to build a machine learning model for the automatic classification of hoax news. Machine learning with deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN), has shown promising results in classifying hoax news. CNN has been used to process text and image input to improve classification performance. By combining text and image data, multimodel has shown better performance compared to models with only one model (unimodel). The comparative analysis between multimodal and unimodal models indicates that the performance of the multimodal model based on both image and text, the Combined CNN Model, is superior.
