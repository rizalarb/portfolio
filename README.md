##### (Feb 2024)

The rise of hoax news is a growing concern, often used to mislead the public. The Indonesian Anti-Defamation Society (Mafindo) manually verifies such news, but this approach is inefficient given the volume of false information. To address this, researchers developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that automatically classifies hoaxes. By combining text and image data, the multimodal CNN significantly outperforms models that use only one type of data, proving to be a more effective solution for combating misinformation.

##### (Jun 2024)

During my internship at PT Japfa Comfeed Indonesia, I worked on three key projects: developing a dashboard for vehicle cost management, conducting an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) analysis for the poultry breeding procurement department, and designing infographics to simplify product brochure information. These projects enhanced my skills in data analysis and visual communication, resulting in improved operational efficiency and clearer information delivery.
