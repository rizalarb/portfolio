The rise of hoax news is a growing concern, often used to mislead the public. The Indonesian Anti-Defamation Society (Mafindo) manually verifies such news, but this approach is inefficient given the volume of false information. To address this, researchers developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that automatically classifies hoaxes. By combining text and image data, the multimodal CNN significantly outperforms models that use only one type of data, proving to be a more effective solution for combating misinformation.
